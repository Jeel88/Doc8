## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/doc8.git
cd doc8
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Database Setup (Crucial Step!) 🗄️
To make the app work (Subjects, Notices, Uploads), run the following SQL script in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to sync everything

-- 1. PROFILES TABLE
create table if not exists profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  email text,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  year text, 
  updated_at timestamp with time zone
);
alter table profiles enable row level security;
create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles for select using (true);
create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles for insert with check (auth.uid() = id);
create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles for update using (auth.uid() = id);

-- 2. SUBJECTS TABLE
create table if not exists subjects (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  year text not null,
  semester text not null,
  icon text,
  color text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users
);
alter table subjects enable row level security;
create policy "Subjects are viewable by everyone." on subjects for select using (true);
create policy "Authenticated users can create subjects" on subjects for insert with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
create policy "Users can delete own subjects" on subjects for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 3. NOTES TABLE
create table if not exists notes (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  title text not null,
  author text,
  file_url text not null,
  file_size text,
  subject_id bigint references subjects(id),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null
);
alter table notes enable row level security;
create policy "Notes are viewable by everyone." on notes for select using (true);
create policy "Authenticated users can insert notes." on notes for insert with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- 4. NOTICES TABLE
create table if not exists notices (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  type text not null,
  attachment_name text,
  attachment_url text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  likes integer default 0,
  dislikes integer default 0
);
alter table notices enable row level security;
create policy "Notices are viewable by everyone." on notices for select using (true);
create policy "Authenticated users can post notices." on notices for insert with check (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
create policy "Users can delete own notices" on notices for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 5. STORAGE BUCKET
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('notes', 'notes', true) on conflict (id) do nothing;
create policy "Authenticated users can upload" on storage.objects for insert to authenticated with check (bucket_id = 'notes');
create policy "Limit size to 10MB" on storage.objects for insert with check ((metadata->>'size')::int <= 10485760);
create policy "Users can delete own files" on storage.objects for delete using (bucket_id = 'notes' and auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
create policy "Anyone can download notes" on storage.objects for select using (bucket_id = 'notes');
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
